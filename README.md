# Decision Jungles
This is a very basic implementation of decision jungles for multiclass classification as proposed by Shotton et al. in [1]. 
It implements the LSearch training algorithm and can be used as a command line tool as well as a library. 

## Command line usage
```shell
$ cmake .
$ make
```
